    <h1>MEW Shifts - App Overview</h1>
    <p>MEW Shifts is a comprehensive shift management tool designed to help shift-based employees manage and monitor their work schedules with ease. It offers real-time attendance tracking, shift scheduling, vacation logging, and customizable shift views to provide users with an accurate, visual representation of their work timeline.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <h3>Shift Scheduling</h3>
